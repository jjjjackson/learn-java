# Which statement is true about lambda expressions?
Ans: 3
1. A lambda expression algorithm always contains a single line of code.
2. A lambda expression's parameter types can always be inferred.
3. It is an inline implementation of a functional interface.
4. It can always be used instead of any anonymous inner class.


# Why would you define classes inside other classes?
Ans: 2
1. To simplify logic and constrain context of use
2. To encapsulate logic and constrain context of use
3. To constrain the use of the class and hide it from the containing class
4. To reuse logic and allow the class to be part of the containing class



# With what is a member inner class associated?
Ans: 4
1. Context of a specific method
2. Inline implementation of an interface
3. Static context of the containing class
4. Instance context of the containing class



# Which statements are true about an anonymous inner class? (Choose two)
Ans: 2, 4
1. It can be an implementation of a functional interface.
2. It can access outer variables, but only if they are final or effectively final.
3. It can access only private variables in the containing class.
4. It is an implementation of an interface or extension of a class.
